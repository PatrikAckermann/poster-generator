# Poster-Generator

The poster generator takes user input to create posters in a HTML canvas. The poster can be an animation or a still image. Using editable text and shapes the Poster-Generator can make many different designs.

You can visit the page [here](https://patrikackermann.github.io/poster-generator/). Using a Chromium browser is recommended.

## **WORK IN PROGRESS**
This site is not finished yet. Some features may not work correctly as they are still being worked on. 
The design is unfinished too. It consists only of a rough layout and some simple styling.

## Examples
Here are a few examples on what's possible with the poster generator.

[![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrikAckermann/poster-generator/master/examples/example1.webm)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrikAckermann/poster-generator/master/examples/example1.webm)

## Animation modes
The Formen (Shapes) mode is the main animation mode of this website. The other ones were created to learn the usage of HTML Canvas.

**"Formen" (Shapes)**

In this mode you can create texts and shapes. They can be freely placed and customized on the poster. The customization includes fonts, colors, sizes, render repetition, and even animations.

**"Links-Rechts" (Left-Right)**

A user specified text moves from left to right with randomized size and speed attributes. The user can set a size and speed multiplicator that gets applied to every text. The user can also change things like fonts.

**"Bounce"**

This is a modified version of the left-right animation. Additionally to the left-right movement it also bounces in and back out of the canvas.

**"DVD"**

This animation replicates the screensaver that is played on DVD players.

## Downloads
