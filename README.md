# Poster-Generator

The poster generator takes user input to create posters in a HTML canvas. The poster can be an animation or a still image. Using editable text and shapes the Poster-Generator can make many different designs.

You can visit the page [here](https://patrikackermann.github.io/poster-generator/). Using a Chromium browser is recommended.
